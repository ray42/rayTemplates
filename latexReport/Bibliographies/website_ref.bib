    Abstract = {Our goal is to minimize the communication costs of Krylov Subspace Methods (KSMs) to solve either Ax=b or
Ax = lambda x, when A is a large sparse matrix. By communication costs we mean both bandwidth and latency costs, either between processors on a parallel computer, or between levels of a memory hierarchy on a sequential computer.
As the cost of communication is growing exponentially relative to computation on modern computers, reducing
communication is becoming ever more important. It is possible to reduce communication costs to near their theoretical minima: On a parallel computer this means latency costs are independent of the dimension k of the Krylov subspace, 
as opposed to growing proportionally to k for a conventional implementation. On a sequential computer, this mean latency and bandwidth costs are independent of k. Achieving this speedup requires a new algorithmic formulation of KSMs.

In this paper we present just part of this new formulation, namely computing a basis of the Krylov subspace spanned 
by [x,Ax, A^2x, ... A^kx]; other papers will present the rest of the KSM formulation. We present theory, performance models, and computational results: Our parallel performance models of 2D and 3D model problems predict speedups over a conventional algorithm of up to 15x on a model Petaflop machine, and up to 22x on a model of the Grid. Our sequential performance models of the same model problems predict speedups over a conventional algorithm of up to 10x on an out-of-core implementation, and up to 2.5x on Intel Clovertown, where we use our ideas to reduce off-chip latency and bandwidth to DRAM. Finally, we measured a speedup of over 3x on an actual out-of-core implementation.

We also consider the related kernel [Ax,MAx,AMAx,...,A(MA)^{k-1}x,(MA)^kx], which arises in preconditioned KSMs.
Under certain mathematical conditions on A and the preconditioner $M$, we show how to avoid latency and bandwidth for this kernel as well.}

abstract = "The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development, integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries within an object-oriented framework for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scienti c problems. Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software.
\par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.
\par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates high quality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software."}
