%Countless programmers have learned C++ from previous editions of C++ Primer
%.  During that time, C++ has matured greatly: Its focus, and that of its
%programming community, has widened from looking mostly at machine efficiency
%to devoting more attention to programmer efficiency.
%  
%In 2011, the C++ standards committee issued a major revision to the ISO C++
%standard. This revised standard is latest step in C++’s evolution and
%continues the emphasis on programmer efficiency. The primary goals of the
%new standard are to
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Make the language more uniform and easier to teach and to learn
%\item Make the standard libraries easier, safer, and more efficient to use
%\item Make it easier to write efficient abstractions and libraries
%\end{itemize}
%In this edition, we have completely revised the C++ Primer to use the latest
%standard. 
%
%%You can get an idea of how extensively the new standard has
%%affected C++ by reviewing the New Features Table of Contents, which lists
%%the sections that cover new material and appears on page xxi.
% 
%Some additions in the new standard, such as \ctt{auto} for type inference,
%are pervasive.  These facilities make the code in this edition easier to
%read and to understand.  Programs (and programmers!) can ignore type
%details, which makes it easier to concentrate on what the program is
%intended to do.  Other new features, such as smart pointers and move-enabled
%containers, let us write more sophisticated classes without having to
%contend with the intricacies of resource management. As a result, we can
%start to teach how to write your own classes much earlier in the book than
%we did in the Fourth Edition. We, and you, no longer have to worry about
%many of the details that stood in our way under the previous standard.
%
%
%Fully updated and recast for the newly released C++11 standard, this
%authoritative and comprehensive introduction to C++ will help you to learn
%the language fast, and to use it in modern, highly effective ways.
%Highlighting today's best practices, the authors show how to use both the
%core language and its standard library to write efficient, readable, and
%powerful code.
%
%C++ Primer, Fifth Edition, introduces the C++ standard library from the
%outset, drawing on its common functions and facilities to help you write
%useful programs without first having to master every language detail. The
%book's many examples have been revised to use the new language features and
%demonstrate how to make the best use of them. This book is a proven tutorial
%for those new to C++, an authoritative discussion of core C++ concepts and
%techniques, and a valuable resource for experienced programmers, especially
%those eager to see C++11 enhancements illuminated.
