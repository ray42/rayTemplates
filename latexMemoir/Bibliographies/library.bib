abstract = {Want to learn how to program in C++ immediately? Want to start writing better, more powerful C++ programs today? Accelerated C++{\&}apos;s uniquely modern approach will help you learn faster and more fluently than you ever believed possible. Based on the authors{\&}apos; intensive summer C++ courses at Stanford University, Accelerated C++ covers virtually every concept that most professional C++ programmers will ever use - but it turns the "traditional" C++ curriculum upside down, starting with the high-level C++ data structures and algorithms that let you write robust programs immediately. Once you{\&}apos;re getting results, Accelerated C++ takes you "under the hood," introducing complex language features such as memory management in context, and explaining exactly how and when to use them. From start to finish, the book concentrates on solving problems, rather than learning language and library features for their own sake. The result: You{\&}apos;ll be writing real-world programs in no time - and outstanding code faster than you ever imagined.},

@article{Hazel2003a,
abstract = {A fully coupled finite-element method is used to investigate the steady flow of a viscous fluid through a thin-walled elastic tube mounted between two rigid tubes. The steady three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations are solved simultaneously with the equations of geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shell theory. If the transmural (internal minus external) pressure acting on the tube is sufficiently negative then the tube buckles non-axisymmetrically and the subsequent large deformations lead to a strong interaction between the fluid and solid mechanics. The main effect of fluid inertia on the macroscopic behaviour of the system is due to the Bernoulli effect, which induces an additional local pressure drop when the tube buckles and its cross-sectional area is reduced. Thus, the tube collapses more strongly than it would in the absence of fluid inertia. Typical tube shapes and flow fields are presented. In strongly collapsed tubes, at finite values of the Reynolds number, two 'jets' develop downstream of the region of strongest collapse and persist for considerable axial distances. For sufficiently high values of the Reynolds number, these jets impact upon the sidewalls and spread azimuthally. The consequent azimuthal transport of momentum dramatically changes the axial velocity profiles, which become approximately Theta-shaped when the flow enters the rigid downstream pipe. Further convection of momentum causes the development of a ring-shaped velocity profile before the ultimate return to a parabolic profile far downstream.},

abstract = {Despite application of cryogen spray (CS) precooling, customary treatment of port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks with a single laser pulse does not result in complete lesion blanching for a majority of patients. One obvious reason is nonselective absorption by epidermal melanin, which limits the maximal safe radiant exposure. Another possible reason for treatment failure is screening of laser light within large PWS vessels, which prevents uniform heating of the entire vessel lumen. Our aim is to identify the parameters of sequential CS cooling and laser irradiation that will allow optimal photocoagulation of various PWS blood vessels with minimal risk of epidermal thermal damage.},

@article{Hogg2013,
abstract = {At the heart of many computations in engineering lies the need to efficiently and accurately solve large sparse linear systems of equations. Direct methods are frequently the method of choice ecause of their robustness, accuracy and their potential for use as black-box solvers. In the last few years, there have been many new developments and a number of new modern parallel general-purpose sparse solvers have been written for inclusion within the HSL mathematical software library (http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/). In this paper, we introduce and briefly review these solvers for symmetrically structured sparse systems. We describe the algorithms used, highlight key features (including bit-compatibility and out-of-core working), and then, using problems arising from a range of engineering applications, we illustrate and compare their performances. We demonstrate that modern direct solvers are able to accurately solve systems of order 10{\^{}}6 in less than 10 minutes on an 8-core machine.},

abstract = {The parallel ordering of large graphs is a difficult problem, because on the one hand minimum degree algorithms do not parallelize well, and on the other hand the obtainment of high quality orderings with the nested dissection algorithm requires efficient graph bipartitioning heuristics, the best sequential implementations of which are also hard to parallelize. This paper presents a set of algorithms, implemented in the PT-Scotch software package, which allows one to order large graphs in parallel, yielding orderings the quality of which is only slightly worse than the one of state-of-the-art sequential algorithms. Our implementation uses the classical nested dissection approach but relies on several novel features to solve the parallel graph bipartitioning problem. Thanks to these improvements, PT-Scotch produces consistently better orderings than ParMeTiS on large numbers of processors. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A detailed comparison between the finite element method (FEM) and the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is presented. As a realistic test case, three-dimensional fluid flow simulations in an SMRX static mixer were performed. The SMRX static mixer is a piece of equipment with excellent mixing performance and it is used as a highly efficient chemical reactor for viscous systems like polymers. The complex geometry of this mixer makes such three-dimensional simulations non-trivial. An excellent agreement between the results of the two simulation methods was found. Furthermore, the numerical results for the pressure drop as a function of the flow rate were close to experimental measurements. Results show that the relatively simple LBM is a good alternative to traditional methods. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent years a number of solvers for the direct solution of large sparse, symmetric linear systems of equations have been developed. These include solvers that are designed for the solution of positive-definite systems as well as those that are principally intended for solving indefinite problems. The available choice can make it difficult for users to know which solver is the most appropriate for their applications. In this study, we use performance profiles as a tool for evaluating and comparing the performance of serial sparse direct solvers on an extensive set of symmetric test problems taken from a range of practical applications.},

This includes standard additive Schwarz domain decomposition methods, aggressive coarsening multigrid, and three preconditioners based on an approximate block LU factorization, specifically SIMPLEC, LSC, and PCD. Robustness is considered with a particular focus on the impact that different stabilization methods have on preconditioner performance. Additionally, parallel scaling studies are undertaken. The numerical results indicate that aggressive coarsening multigrid, LSC and PCD all have good algorithmic scalability. Coupling this with the fact that block methods can be applied to systems arising from stable mixed discretizations implies that these techniques are a promising direction for developing scalable methods for Navier-Stokes. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {For a number of linear systems of equations arising from realistic problems, using the Bi-CGSTAB algorithm of van der Vorst [17] to solve these equations is very attractive. Unfortunately, for a large class of equations, where, for instance, Bi-CG performs well, the convergence of Bi- CGSTAB stagnates. This was observed specifically in case of discretized advection dominated PDE's. The stagnation is due to the fact that for this type of equations the matrix has almost pure imaginary eigenvalues. With his BiCGStab2 algorithm Gutknecht [5] attempted to avoid this stagnation. Here, we generalize the Bi-CGSTAB algorithm further, and overcome some shortcomings of BiCGStab2. In some sense, the new algorithm combines GMRES(l) and Bi-CG and profits from both.},

abstract = {Matrix computing arises in the solution of almost all linear and nonlinear sys- tems of equations. As the computer power upsurges and high resolution sim- ulations are attempted, a method can reach its applicability limits quickly and hence there is a constant demand for new and fast matrix solvers. Precondi- tioning is the key to a successful iterative solver. It is the intention of this book to present a comprehensive exposition of the many useful preconditioning techniques. Preconditioning equations mainly serve for an iterative method and are often solved by a direct solver (occasionally by another iterative solver). Therefore it is inevitable to address direct solution techniques for both sparse and dense matrices. While fast solvers are frequently associated with iterative solvers, for special problems, a direct solver can be competitive. Moreover, there are situations where preconditioning is also needed for a direct solution method. This clearly demonstrates the close relationship between a direct and an iterative method. This book is the first of its kind attempting to address an active research topic, covering these main types of preconditioners. Type 1 Matrix splitting preconditioner FEM setting Type 2 Approximate inverse preconditioner FEM setting Type 3 Multilevel (approximate inverse) preconditioner FEM setting Type 4 Recursive Schur complements preconditioner FEM setting Type 5 Matrix splitting and Approximate inverses Wavelet setting Type 6 Recursive Schur complements preconditioner Wavelet setting Type 7 Implicit wavelet preconditioner FEM setting Here by ‘FEM setting', we mean a usual matrix (as we found it) often formed from discretization by finite element methods (FEM) for partial differential equations with piecewise polynomial basis functions whilst the ‘Wavelet setting' refers to wavelet discretizations. The iterative solvers, often called accelerators, are selected to assist and motivate preconditioning. As we believe that suitable preconditioners can work with most accelerators, many other variants of accelerators are only briefly mentioned to allow us a better focus on the main theme. However these accelerators are well documented in whole or in part in the more recent as well as the more classical survey books or monographs},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Oligomerization of transmembrane (TM) helices is a key stage in the folding of membrane proteins. Glycophorin A (GpA) is a well-documented test system for this process. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) allows us to simulate the self-assembly of TM helices into dimers, for both wild-type (WT) and mutant GpA sequences. For the WT sequences, dimers formed rapidly and remained stable in all simulations. The resultant dimers exhibited right-handed crossing and the same interhelix contacts as in NMR structures. Simulations of disruptive mutants revealed the dimers were less stable, with values of DeltaDelta G dimerization consistent with experimental data. The dimers of disruptive mutants were distorted relative to the WT and showed left-handed crossing of their helices. CG-MD can therefore be used to explore the interactions of TM helices, an important stage in the folding of membrane proteins. In particular, CG-MD has been shown to be sensitive enough to detect disruptions introduced by mutation. Future refinement of such models via atomistic simulations will enable a multiscale approach to predict the folding of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Mixed finite element approximation of the classical Stokes problem describing slow viscous incompressible flow gives rise to symmetric indefinite systems for the discrete velocity and pressure variables. Iterative solution of such indefinite systems is feasible and is an attractive approach for large problems. The use of stabilisation methods for convenient (but unstable) mixed elements introduces stabilisation parameters. The authors show how these can be chosen to obtain rapid iterative convergence. The authors propose a conjugate gradient-like method (the method of preconditioned conjugate residuals) that is applicable to symmetric indefinite problems, describe the effects of stabilisation on the algebraic structure of the discrete Stokes operator, and derive estimates of the eigenvalue spectrum of this operator on which the convergence rate of the iteration depends. The simple case of diagonal preconditioning is discussed. The results apply to both locally and globally stabilised mixed elements as well as to elements which are inherently stable. It is demonstrated that convergence rates comparable to that achieved using the diagonally scaled conjugate gradient method applied to the discrete Laplacian are approachable for the Stokes problem.},

abstract = {After applying the Finite Element Method (FEM) to the diffusion-type and wave-type Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), a first order and a second order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems are obtained respectively. These ODE systems usually present high stiffness, so numerical methods with good stability properties are required in their resolution. MATLAB offers a set of open source adaptive step functions for solving ODEs. One of these functions is the ode15s recommended to solve stiff problems and which is based on the Backward Differentiation Formulae (BDF). We describe the error estimation and the step size control implemented in this function. The ode15s is a variable order algorithm, and even though it has an adaptive step size implementation, the advancing formula and the local error estimation that uses correspond to the constant step size formula. We have focused on the second order accurate and unconditionally stable BDF (BDF2) and we have implemented a real adaptive step size BDF2 algorithm using the same strategy as the BDF2 implemented in the ode15s, resulting the new algorithm more efficient than the one implemented in MATLAB. {\textcopyright} The Authors.

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

We analyze the properties of the corresponding preconditioned matrices, in particular their spectra and discuss the computational performances of the preconditioned iterative methods. We show that fast convergence depends mainly on the quality of the splitting of the (1,1)-block.

This paper analyzes this sort of turn by investigating the case of computational quantum chemistry. The main claim is that the transformation from quantum to computational quantum chemistry involved changes in three dimensions. First, on the side of instrumentation, small computers and a networked infrastructure took over the lead from centralized mainframe architecture. Second, a new conception of computational modeling became feasible and assumed a crucial role. And third, the field of computational quantum chemistry became organized in a market-like fashion and this market is much bigger than the number of quantum theory experts. These claims will be substantiated by an investigation of the so-called density functional theory (DFT), the arguably pivotal theory in the turn to computational quantum chemistry around 1990. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Mavriplis2006,
abstract = {Efficient solution strategies for the steady-state lattice Boltzmann equation are investigated. Stable iterative methods for the linearized lattice Boltzmann equation are formulated based on the linearization of the lattice Boltzmann time-stepping procedure. These are applied as relaxation methods within a linear multigrid scheme, which itself is used to drive a Newton solver for the full non-linear problem. Although the linear multigrid strategy provides rapid convergence, the cost of a linear residual evaluation is found to be substantially higher than the cost of evaluating the non-linear residual directly. Therefore, a non-linear multigrid approach is adopted, which makes use of the non-linear LBE time-stepping scheme on each grid level. Rapid convergence to steady-state is achieved by the non-linear algorithm, resulting in one or more orders of magnitude increase in solution efficiency over the LBE time-integration approach. Grid-independent convergence rates are demonstrated, although degradation with increasing Reynolds number is observed, as in the case of the original LBE time-stepping scheme. The multigrid solver is implemented in a modular fashion by calling an existing LBE time-stepping routine, and delivers the identical steady-state solution as the original LBE time-stepping approach. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

After a short review of the basic model and extensions, we compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of two research simulation codes based on the LB and the finite-element method (FEM) for two-dimensional incompressible laminar flow problems with complex geometries. We also study the influence of the Mach number on the solution, since LB methods are weakly compressible by nature, by comparing compressible and incompressible results obtained from the LB code and the commercial code CFX. Our results indicate, that for the quantities studied (lift, drag, pressure drop) our LB prototype is competitive for incompressible transient problems, but asymptotically slower for steady-state Stokes flow because the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the classical LB-method is not optimal compared to the multigrid solvers incorporated in the FEM and CFX code. For the weakly compressible case, the LB approach has a significant wall clock time advantage as compared to CFX. In addition, we demonstrate that the influence of the finite Mach number in LB simulations of incompressible flow is easily underestimated. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The potential availability of analytical treatment of this problem stems from the smallness of mass of the star and cluster relative to the galactic mass, giving rise to Hill's restricted three-body problem in the galaxy-cluster-star context. Based on this observation, this paper presents a Hamiltonian approach to modelling stellar motion by the derivation of canonical coordinates for the dynamics of a star relative to a star cluster. First, the Hamiltonian is partitioned into a linear term and a high-order term. The Hamilton-Jacobi equations are solved for the linear part by separation, and new constants for the relative motions are obtained, called epicyclic orbital elements. The effect of an arbitrary cluster potential is incorporated into the analysis by a variation of parameters procedure. A numerical optimization technique is developed based on the new orbital elements, and quasiperiodic stellar orbits are found. ?? 2005 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The existence of a discontinuity in the Strouhal-Reynolds number relationship for the laminar vortex shedding of a cylinder is found to be caused by a change in the mode of oblique shedding. By 'inducing' parallel shedding (from manipulating end conditions) the resulting Strouhal curve becomes completely continuous and agrees very well with the oblique-shedding data, if it is transformed by S(0) = S(theta)/cos theta, where S(theta) is the Strouhal number corresponding with the oblique-shedding angle theta. The curve also agrees with data from a completely different facility. This provides evidence that this Strouhal curve is universal (for a circular cylinder).},

abstract = {The development of high performance, massively parallel computers and the increasing demands of computationally challenging applications have ne-cessitated the development of scalable solvers and preconditioners. One of the most effective ways to achieve scalability is the use of multigrid or multilevel techniques. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) is a very efficient algorithm for solving large problems on unstructured grids. While much of it can be parallelized in a straightforward way, some components of the classical algorithm, particularly the coarsening process and some of the most efficient smoothers, are highly sequential, and require new par-allel approaches. This chapter presents the basic principles of AMG and gives an overview of various parallel implementations of AMG, including descriptions of par-allel coarsening schemes and smoothers, some numerical results as well as references to existing software packages.},

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

abstract = {A short survey of recent research on Krylov subspace methods with emphasis on implementation on vector and parallel computers is presented. Conjugate gradient methods have proven very useful on traditional scalar computers, and their popularity is likely to increase as three-dimensional models gain importance. A conservative approach to derive effective iterative techniques for supercomputers has been to find efficient parallel/vector implementations of the standard algorithms. The main source of difficulty in the incomplete factorization preconditionings is in the solution of the triangular systems at each step. A few approaches consisting of implementing efficient forward and backward triangular solutions are described in detail. Polynomial preconditioning as an alternative to standard incomplete factorization techniques is also discussed. Another efficient approach is to reorder the equations so as to improve the structure of the matrix to achieve better parallelism or vectorization. An overview of these and other ideas and their effectiveness or potential for different types of architectures is given.},

This model includes important dynamic characteristics of tethered spacecraft in orbit, namely the nonlinear coupling between tether deformations, rotational dynamics of rigid bodies, a reeling mechanism, and orbital dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, referred to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. The structure-preserving properties are particularly useful for studying complex dynamics of a tethered spacecraft. These properties are illustrated by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new algorithm to define a stable Lagrange multiplier space to impose stiff interface conditions within the context of the extended finite element method. In contrast to earlier approaches, we do not work with an interior penalty formulation as, e.g. for Nitsche techniques, but impose the constraints weakly in terms of Lagrange multipliers. Roughly speaking a stable and optimal discrete Lagrange multiplier space has to satisfy two criteria: a best approximation property and a uniform inf–sup condition. Owing to the fact that the interface does not match the edges of the mesh, the choice of a good discrete Lagrange multiplier space is not trivial. Here we propose a new algorithm for the local construction of the Lagrange multiplier space and show that a uniform inf–sup condition is satisfied. A counterexample is also presented, i.e. the inf–sup constant depends on the mesh-size and degenerates as it tends to zero. Numerical results in two-dimensional confirm the theoretical ones.},

The mathematical characteristics of the equation depend on the governing process, for example, when time scales for advection tA, reaction tR and diffusion tD have different orders of magnitude. On the other hand, this equation is based on a continuum model, disregarding inhomogeneities that happen at poral level just where reactions take place. To deal with these problems a different way of modeling the advection-reaction-diffusion process is proposed. Based on the Damkohler number an algorithm has been developed to solve the problem for both slow and fast reactions. Spatial segregation of reactants can be incorporated improving the results. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For proper norms, we prove that the smoothing property and the approximation property hold with constants that are independent of the small parameter. Thus we obtain robust and optimal convergence rates for theWcycle and the variable V-cycle multigrid methods.

Although we can use these multiprocessors for time-sharing applications, it would be preferable to use them as true parallel processors. One key to achieving efficient parallel processing is to match the communications capabilities of the multiprocessor to the communications needs of the problem. The other key is improved parallel programming systems. If these are achieved, then efficient parallel processing can be approached from both ends by providing more communications capability in the hardware and restructuring the problem to reduce the communications requirements.},

abstract = {Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly reproduced the 'cosmic web' of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies, because of numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a cube of 106.5 megaparsecs a side. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the 'metal' and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.},

@article{Phan-Thien2013,
abstract = {This book presents an introduction to viscoelasticity; in particular, to the theories of dilute polymer solutions and dilute suspensions of rigid particles in viscous and incompressible fluids. These theories are important, not just because they apply to practical problems of industrial interest, but because they form a solid theoretical base upon which mathematical techniques can be built, from which more complex theories can be constructed, to better mimic material behaviour. The emphasis is not on the voluminous current topical research, but on the necessary tools to understand viscoelasticity at a first year graduate level. The main aim is to provide a still compact book, sufficient at the level of first year graduate course for those who wish to understand viscoelasticity and to embark in modeling of viscoelastic multiphase fluids. To this end, a new chapter on Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) was introduced which is relevant to model complex-structured fluids. All the basic ideas in DPD are reviewed, with some sample problems to illustrate the methodology.},

We focus on the modeling challenges arising from the breakdown of the Navier-Stokes description, observed when characteristic lengthscales become of the order of, or smaller than, the molecular mean free path. We discuss both theoretical results and numerical methods development. Examples of the former include the limit of applicability of the Navier-Stokes constitutive laws, the concept of second-order slip and the appropriate form of such a model, and how to reconcile experimental measurements of slipping flows with theory. We also review a number of recently developed theoretical descriptions of canonical nanoscale flows of engineering interest. On the simulation front, we review recent progress in characterizing the accuracy of the prevalent Boltzmann simulation method known as direct simulation Monte Carlo. We also present recent variance reduction ideas which address the prohibitive cost associated with the statistical sampling of macroscopic properties in low-speed flows.},

The velocity field is found for a fluid in between two wavy-walled plates that oscillate in phase. The wavy-walled boundary causes the flow to produce regions of recirculations within the recesses of the boundary. Once the velocity profiles are identified, the power required to drive the oscillatory fluid motion is then calculated and compared to a flat plate geometry without recesses. As expected, the analytical results show that more power is needed to drive a wavy-walled system than a flat plate configuration. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The possibility of modeling the Navier-Stokes equations and together with the conventional second order slip boundary condition at high Knudsen numbers is explored in this paper by incorporating the Knudsen diffusion phenomenon in rarefied gases. An effective mean free path (MFP) model is augmented to the governing equation and the slip boundary condition, as gas transport properties can be related to the MFP. This simple modification is shown to implicitly take care of the complexities associated in the transitional flow regime, without necessitating dependency of the slip coefficients on the Knudsen number. Unique analytical model with fixed values of slip coefficients is proposed and rigorous comparisons with the experimental and simulation data for pressure driven and thermally driven rarefied gas flows support this conjecture. First and second order slip coefficients have been proposed as 1.1466 and 0.9756 for rectangular channels and 1.1466 and 0.14 for the capillaries, from the continuum to the transition flow regime. The current work is significant from the numerical simulation point of view because simulation tools are better developed for Navier-Stokes equations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Arnold2015,
abstract = {There are several different economic barriers such as high up-front capital costs, high transaction costs and divers risks (e.g. performance and technical, contract risks, market risks) that keep potential investors or institutional lenders from investing in decentralized renewable energy technologies (RETs). Therefore, suitable business models, specific financing concepts and advanced risk management tools to deal with issues concerning transaction costs and financial risks are required to support RET investments.This article deals with this issue by introducing a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) approach to risk analysis based on an entire life-cycle representation of RET-investment projects. By doing this, the authors uncover considerable advantages regarding content and methodology compared to ordinary NPV-estimation or sensitivity analysis. It could be shown that the presented financial analysis combined with MCS aids in optimizing the conceptual design of an investment project with respect to capital returns and risk. Since both issues are decisive for lenders and investors, the double-criteria analysis method presented in this paper facilitates the raising of capital for project investments in decentralized RETs.},

Our intention is to make it as easy as possible to develop reliable and efficient computational continuum-mechanics codes: this is achieved by making the top-level syntax of the code as close as possible to conventional mathematical notation for tensors and partial differential equations. Object-orientation techniques enable the creation of data types that closely mimic those of continuum mechanics, and the operator overloading possible in C++ allows normal mathematical symbols to be used for the basic operations. As an example, the implementation of various types of turbulence modeling in a FOAM computational-fluid-dynamics code is discussed, and calculations performed on a standard test case, that of flow around a square prism, are presented. To demonstrate the flexibility of the FOAM library, codes for solving structures and magnetohydrodynamics are also presented with appropriate test case results given.},

abstract = {The effects of rarefaction on gas viscosity are investigated through the simulation of isothermal, low speed flow in a long straight channel using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Following convergence to the flow field inside the channel, the effective viscosity is calculated directly from its definition using shear stress calculations in each individual cell assuming that the gas flow is close to a local equilibrium state. Averaging over the cross-sectional area at different positions down the pressure gradient allows the determination of the gas viscosity as a function of the local Knudsen number (Kn) along the channel. Following an extensive investigation of this dependence over a wide range of Kn values, it was conveniently found that a Bosanquet- type of approximation describes very satisfactorily the Knudsen number dependence of the viscosity over the entire transition regime, i.e., from the slip-flow to the freemolecular flow limit. Such a simple functional dependence is expected to facilitate significantly phenomenological descriptions and numerical computations of rarefied flows that rely on the notion of an effective viscosity in the transition regime. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2010.},

abstract = {In this paper, mechanical properties of single-walled helically coiled carbon nanotubes are investigated by means of molecular structural mechanics method in ANSYS finite element code. To specify the geometry of coiled carbon nanotubes, a construction procedure is proposed which offers a full control over the morphology of the coiled nanotubes. In this construction approach, first a development map is drawn on a graphene sheet and then this graphene sheet is rolled to form a defected straight carbon nanotube; then, the sides of these defects are stuck together through a nonlinear analysis and finally, the straight carbon nanotube forms into coiled carbon nanotube. Using this construction procedure, several coiled nanotubes are built and their spring constants are calculated. It is shown that the spring constants found are in good agreement with those obtained from density function theory and tight-binding calculations reported in the literature. Moreover, in order to facilitate the simulation of those macroscopic systems which contain coiled carbon nanotubes, an equivalent continuum model is proposed and its mechanical properties are investigated. It is found that, as the tube diameter increases, both spring constant and shear modulus of the coiled carbon nanotube increase. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present paper addresses the following question: can a simple regulatory bone remodeling model predict effects of unloading conditions on the trabecular bone morphology? In an attempt to answer this question, rat tail-suspension was chosen as a model that mimics the microgravity environment. Over 23 days, histomorphometric analysis was carried out on cross-sections of tibias of the suspended animals. The slices were digitalized and images discretized to obtain osteocyte distribution and apparent bone density. Based on these experimental data, finite element simulations were conducted to evaluate the bone loss and the change in trabecular architecture similar to those observed after a spaceflight. The numerical model is driven by a remodeling law that takes into account the nonuniform osteocyte distribution that may itself provide mechanoreception. We used the bone density rate of change from the remodeling theory and a time stepping algorithm witch are implemented in a finite element software. This approach takes into account the unloading effects on bone remodeling process and permits to confront experimental and numerical data. We showed that there is a good agreement between these data, particularly at the beginning of the simulated bone mass loss during the rat tail-suspension experiment. Indeed, we obtained a variation of 5.25{\%} at day 7 (D7), 2.09{\%} at day 13 (D13) and finally, 51.03{\%} at day 23 (D23). Despite that last variation, the proposed theoretical model can be suitable to simulate the alteration of bone mineral density under the specific unloading conditions of the rat tail-suspension model. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Noisy and scattered versions of the analytical velocity field were generated, and the accuracy in reconstructing the analytical field was evaluated. It was found that accuracy depends on the value of a regularization parameter, and its optimal value depends on the entity of noise and scattering. When the optimal value is selected, the accuracy of the regularization technique is excellent, even for consistent noise and scattering levels.

abstract = {Cloud Computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over- provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under- provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hlarge scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.},

In this paper, we computationally study the folding rate for a kinetics problem of protein folding by solving a large-scale eigenvalue problem. Three numerical methods, the implicitly restarted Arnoldi, the Jacobi-Davidson, and the QR methods are applied to solve the corresponding large-scale eigenvalue problem of the transition matrix of the master equation. Comparison among three methods is performed in terms of the computational efficiency. It is found that the QR method demands tremendous computing resource when the length of sequence L {\textgreater} 10 due to the extremely large size of matrix and CPU time limitation. The Jacobi-Davidson method may encounter convergence issues, for some testing cases with L {\textgreater} 9. Among the three solution methods the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method is suitable for solving the problem. Numerical examples with various residues are investigated.},

abstract = {Although Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting is a robust algorithm to solve unsymmetric sparse linear systems of equations, it is difficult to implement efficiently on parallel machines because of its dynamic and somewhat unpredictable way of generating work and intermediate results at run time. In this paper, we present an efficient parallel algorithm that overcomes this difficulty. The high performance of our algorithm is achieved through (1) using a graph reduction technique and a supernode-panel computational kernel for high single processor utilization, and (2) scheduling two types of parallel tasks for a high level of concurrency. One such task is factoring the independent panels in the disjoint subtrees of the column elimination tree of A. Another task is updating a panel by previously computed supernodes. A scheduler assigns tasks to free processors dynamically and facilitates the smooth transition between the two types of parallel tasks. No global synchronization is used in the algorithm. The algorithm is well suited for shared memory machines (SMP) with a modest number of processors. We demonstrate 4-to 7-fold speedups on a range of 8 processor SMPs, and more on larger SMPs. One realistic problem arising from a 3-D flow calculation achieves factorization rates of 1.0, 2.5, 0.8, and 0.8 gigaflops on the 12 processor Power Challenge, 8 processor Cray C90, 16 processor Cray J90, and 8 processor AlphaServer 8400.},

abstract = {We introduce numerical algorithms for initializing multidimensional simulations of stellar explosions with 1D stellar evolution models. The initial mapping from 1D profiles onto multidimensional grids can generate severe numerical artifacts, one of the most severe of which is the violation of conservation laws for physical quantities. We introduce a numerical scheme for mapping 1D spherically-symmetric data onto multidimensional meshes so that these physical quantities are conserved. We verify our scheme by porting a realistic 1D Lagrangian stellar profile to the new multidimensional Eulerian hydro code CASTRO. Our results show that all important features in the profiles are reproduced on the new grid and that conservation laws are enforced at all resolutions after mapping. We also introduce a numerical scheme for initializing multidimensional supernova simulations with realistic perturbations predicted by 1D stellar evolution models. Instead of seeding 3D stellar profiles with random perturbations, we imprint them with velocity perturbations that reproduce the Kolmogorov energy spectrum expected for highly turbulent convective regions in stars. Our models return Kolmogorov energy spectra and vortex structures like those in turbulent flows before the modes become nonlinear. Finally, we describe approaches to determining the resolution for simulations required to capture fluid instabilities and nuclear burning. Our algorithms are applicable to multidimensional simulations besides stellar explosions that range from astrophysics to cosmology. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Lanczos algorithm is most commonly used in approximating a small number of extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors for symmetric large sparse matrices. Main memory accesses for shared memory systems or global communications (synchronizations) in message passing systems decrease the computation speed. In this paper, the standard Lanczos algorithm is restructured so that only one synchronization point is required; that is, one global communication in a message passing distributed-memory machine or one global communication in a message passing distributed-memory machine or one global memory sweep in a shared-memory machine per each iteration is required. We also introduce the s-step Lanczos method for finding a few eigenvalues of symmetric large sparse matrices in a similar way to the s-step Conjugate Gradient method [2], and we prove that the s-step method generates reduction matrices which are similar to reduction matrices generated by the standard method. One iteration of the s-step Lanczos algorithm corresponds to s iterations of the standard Lanczos algorithm. The s-step method has improved data locality, minimized global communication and has superior parallel properties to the standard method. These algorithms are implemented on a 64-node NCUBE/seven hypercube and a CRAY-2, and performance results are presented. ?? 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study was carried out for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. The treatment of malignant diseases, after its primary treatment by surgery, is either by external beam radiotherapy, which is effective but local, or by chemotherapy, which is effective but not selective. The radiotherapy labelled antibody has to be able to penetrate the whole of the tumour, whereas for imaging only uptake on the surface of the tumour is needed. Factors such as dose, rate delivered, tumor size, and radiosensitivity play a major role in determining therapeutic response, while target-to-nontarget ratios and, particularly, circulating radioactivity to the bone marrow determine the major dose-limiting toxicities. In this article, we introduced a system of differential equations with small parameter with applications in radioimmunotherapy. The problem consists of two partial differential equations. Both the equation of this system includes small parameter epsilon. We introduce the mathematical technique known as boundary function method for singular perturbation system. In this system, the small parameter is an asymptotic variable, different from the independent variable. We write solution of this system in a small parameter, and investigation of asymptotic solution for system. Using the program Matlab and numerical method Runge-Kutta, I did various simulations for different values of biological parameters presented in the model studied.},

@book{Barretta,
abstract = {Which of the following statements is true? • Users want “black box” software that they can use with complete confidence for general problem classes without having to understand the fine algorithmic details. • Users want to be able to tune data structures for a particular application, even if the software is not as reliable as that provided for general methods. It turns out both are true, for different groups of users. Traditionally, users have asked for and been provided with black box software in the form of mathematical libraries such as LAPACK, LINPACK, NAG, and IMSL. More recently, the high performance community has discovered that they must write custom software for their problem. Their reasons include inadequate functionality of existing software libraries, data structures that are not natural or convenient for a particular problem, and overly general software that sacrifices too much performance when applied to a special case of interest. Can we meet the needs of both groups of users? We believe we can. Accordingly, in this book, we introduce the use of templates. A template is a description of a general algorithm rather than the executable object code or the source code more commonly found in a conventional software library. Nevertheless, although templates are general descriptions of key algorithms, they offer whatever degree of customization the user may desire. For example, they can be configured for the specific data structure of a problem or for the specific computing system on which the problem is to run. We focus on the use of iterative methods for solving large sparse systems of linear equations. Many methods exist for solving such problems. The trick is to find the most effective method for the problem at hand. Unfortunately, a method that works well for one problem type may not work as well for another. Indeed, it may not work at all. Thus, besides providing templates, we suggest how to choose and implement an effective method, and how to specialize a method to specific matrix types. We restrict ourselves to iter ative methods, which work by repeatedly improving an approximate solution until it is accurate enough. These methods access the coefficient matrix A of the linear system only via the matrix vector product y = A {\textperiodcentered} x (and perhaps z = A T {\textperiodcentered} x). Thus the user need only supply a subroutine for computing y (and perhaps z) given x, which permits full exploitation of the sparsity or other special structure of A. We believe that after reading this book, applications developers will be able to use templates to get their program running on a parallel machine quickly. Nonspecialists will know how to choose and implement an approach to solve a particular problem. Specialists will be able to assemble and modify their codes—without having to make the huge investment that has, up to now, been required to tune large-scale applications for each particular machine. Finally, we hope that all users will gain a better understanding of the algorithms employed. While education has not been one of 1 the traditional goals of mathematical software, we believe that our approach will go a long way in providing such a valuable service.},

@article{Mihajlovic2002,
abstract = {A preconditioning methodology for an iterative solution of discrete stress analysis problems based on a space decomposition and subspace correction framework is analysed in this paper. The principle idea of our approach is a decomposition of a global discrete system into the series of subproblems each of which correspond to the different Cartesian co-ordinates of the solution (displacement) vector. This enables us to treat the matrix subproblems in a segregated way. A host of well-established scalar solvers can be employed for the solution of subproblems. In this paper we constrain ourselves to an approximate solution using the scalar algebraic multigrid (AMG) solver, while the subspace correction is performed either in block diagonal (Jacobi) or block lower triangular (Gauss–Seidel) fashion. The preconditioning methodology is justified theoretically for the case of the block-diagonal preconditioner using Korn's inequality for estimating the ratio between the extremal eigenvalues of a preconditioned matrix. The effectiveness of the AMG-based preconditioner is tested on stress analysis 3D model problems that arise in microfabrication technology. The numerical results, which are in accordance with theoretical predictions, clearly demonstrate the superiority of a component decomposition AMG preconditioner over the standard ILU preconditioner, even for the problems with a relatively small number of degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {A parallel preconditioner is presented for the solution of general sparse linear systems of equations. A sparse approximate inverse is computed explicitly and then applied as a preconditioner to an iterative method. The computation of the preconditioner is inherently parallel, and its application only requires a matrix-vector product. The sparsity pattern of the approximate inverse is not imposed a priori but captured automatically. This keeps the amount of work and the number of nonzero entries in the preconditioner to a minimum. Rigorous bounds on the clustering of the eigenvalues and the singular values are derived for the preconditioned system, and the proximity of the approximate to the true inverse is estimated. An extensive set of test problems from scientific and industrial applications provides convincing evidence of the effectiveness of this approach.},

This, together with the sophistication of modern financial products, provides a rapidly growing impetus for new mathematical models and modern mathematical methods; the area is an expanding source for novel and relevant 'real-world' mathematics. In this book the authors describe the modelling of financial derivative products from an applied mathematician's viewpoint, from modelling through analysis to elementary computation. A unified approach to modelling derivative products as partial differential equations is presented, using numerical solutions where appropriate. Some mathematics is assumed, but clear explanations are provided for material beyond elementary calculus, probability, and algebra. Over 140 exercises are included. This volume will become the standard introduction to this exciting new field for advanced undergraduate students.},

abstract = {In this article recent advances in the Marker and Cell (MAC) method will be reviewed. The MAC technique dates back to the early 1960s at the Los Alamos Laboratories and this article starts with a historical review, and then a brief discussion of related techniques. Improvements since the early days of MAC (and the Simplified MAC - SMAC) include automatic time-stepping, the use of the conjugate gradient method to solve the Poisson equation for the corrected velocity potential, greater efficiency through stripping out the virtual particles (markers) other than those near the free surface, and more accurate approximations of the free surface boundary conditions, the addition of bounded high accuracy upwinding for the convected terms (thereby being able to solve higher Reynolds number flows), and a (dynamics) flow visualization facility. More recently, effective techniques for surface and interfacial flows and, in particular, for accurately tracking the associated surface(s)/interface(s) including moving contact angles have been developed. This article will concentrate principally on a three-dimensional version of the SMAC method. It will eschew both code verification and model validation; instead it will emphasize the applications that the MAC method can solve, from multiphase flows to rheology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The construction of the preconditioners requires only matrix-vector products, is breakdown-free, and does not need to form the matrix. The memory requirements of the preconditioners are defined in advance, and they do not depend on the number of nonzero entries in the matrix. When eigenvalue deflation is used, the preconditioners turn out to be suitable for solving sequences of slowly changing systems or linear systems with different right-hand sides. Numerical results are provided, including the case of sequences arising in nonnegative linear least-squares problems solved by interior point methods.},

Since then, while I have had ample opportunity to teach, use, and even program numerous ideas from vector calculus, tensor analysis has faded from my consciousness. How much it had faded became clear recently when I tried to program the viscosity tensor into my fluids code, and couldn't account for, much less derive, the myriad of “strange terms” (ultimately from the dreaded “Christ-awful” symbols) that arise when programming a tensor quantity valid in curvilinear coordinates. My goal here is to reconstruct my understanding of tensor analysis enough to make the connexion between covarient, contravariant, and physical vector components, to understand the usual vector derivative constructs (∇, ∇{\textperiodcentered}, ∇×) in terms of tensor differentiation, to put dyads (e.g., ∇{\~{}}v) into proper context, to understand how to derive certain identities involving tensors, and finally, the true test, how to program a realistic viscous tensor to endow a fluid with the non-isotropic stresses associated with Newtonian viscosity in curvilinear coordinates.},

The slip boundary condition is appropriate for problems that involve free boundaries, flows past chemically reacting walls, and other examples where the usual no-slip condition u = 0 is not valid. The two-level algorithm consists of solving a small nonlinear system of equations on the coarse mesh and then using that solution to solve a larger linear system on the fine mesh. The two-level method exploits the quadratic nonlinearity in the Navier-Stokes equations.

abstract = {The three-term Lanczos process for a symmetric matrix leads to bases for Krylov subspaces of increasing dimension. The Lanczos basis, together with the recurrence coefficients, can be used for the solution of symmetric indefinite linear systems, by solving a reduced system in one way or another. This leads to well-known methods: MINRES (minimal residual), GMRES ( generalized minimal residual), and SYMMLQ ( symmetric LQ). We will discuss in what way and to what extent these approaches di er in their sensitivity to rounding errors. In our analysis we will assume that the Lanczos basis is generated in exactly the same way for the different methods, and we will not consider the errors in the Lanczos process itself. We will show that the method of solution may lead, under certain circumstances, to large additional errors, which are not corrected by continuing the iteration process. Our findings are supported and illustrated by numerical examples.},

A new efficient preconditioning methodology introduced by Kay et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2002; 24:237-256) is applied and its effectiveness in the context of a Newton linearization is investigated. The original strategy was introduced as a preconditioning methodology for discrete Oseen equations that arise from Picard linearization. Our new variant of the preconditioning strategy is constructed from building blocks consisting of two component multigrid cycles; a multigrid V-cycle for a scalar convection-diffusion operator; and a multigrid V-cycle for a pressure Poisson operator. We present numerical experiments showing that the convergence rate of the preconditioned GMRES is independent of the grid size and relatively insensitive to the Reynolds number.

A new stability condition relating the interior and boundary subspaces is first derived, which is easier to check in practice than the condition known so far. Using the new condition, compatible boundary subspaces are constructed for quasiuniform triangular and rectangular interior meshes in two dimensions. The stability and optimal-order convergence of the finite element methods based on the constructed subspaces are proved.},

@article{Henson2002,
abstract = {Driven by the need to solve linear systems arising from problems posed on extremely large, unstructured grids, there has been a recent resurgence of interest in algebraic multigrid (AMG). AMG is attractive in that it holds out the possibility of multigrid-like performance on unstructured grids. The sheer size of many modern physics and simulation problems has led to the development of massively parallel computers, and has sparked much research into developing algorithms for them. Parallelizing AMG is a difficult task, however. While much of the AMG method parallelizes readily, the process of coarse-grid selection, in particular, is fundamentally sequential in nature. We have previously introduced a parallel algorithm [A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones, in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] for the selection of coarse-grid points, based on modifications of certain parallel independent set algorithms and the application of heuristics designed to insure the quality of the coarse grids, and shown results from a prototype serial version of the algorithm. In this paper we describe an implementation of a parallel AMG code, using the algorithm of A.J. Cleary, R.D. Falgout, V.E. Henson, J.E. Jones [in: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Solving Irregularly Structured Problems in Parallel, Springer, New York, 1998] as well as other approaches to parallelizing the coarse-grid selection. We consider three basic coarsening schemes and certain modifications to the basic schemes, designed to address specific performance issues. We present numerical results for a broad range of problem sizes and descriptions, and draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of the method. Finally, we indicate the current directions of the research.},

abstract = {The confined flow around a cylinder with square cross-section mounted inside a plane channel (blockage ratio B = 1/8) was investigated in detail by two entirely different numerical techniques, namely a lattice-Boltzmann automata (LBA) and a finite-volume method (FVM). In order to restrict the approach to 2D computations, the largest Reynolds number chosen was Re = 300 based on the maximum inflow velocity and the chord length of the square cylinder. The LBA was built up on the D2Q9 model and the single relaxation time method called the lattice-BGK method. The finite-volume code was based on an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver for arbitrary non-orthogonal, body-fitted grids. Both numerical methods are of second-order accuracy in space and time. Accurate computations were carried out on grids with different resolutions. The results of both methods were evaluated and compared in detail. Both velocity profiles and integral parameters such as drag coefficient, recirculation length and Strouhal number were investigated. Excellent agreement between the LBA and FVM computations was found. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

This concise review of multiscale applications and their source communities in the EU and US outlines differences and commonalities among approaches and identifies areas in which collaboration between disciplines could be particularly beneficial. Because different communities adopt very different approaches to constructing multiscale simulations, and simulations on a length scale of a few meters and a time scale of a few hours can be found in many multiscale research domains, communities might receive additional benefit from sharing methods that are geared towards these scales. The Web extra is the full literature list mentioned in the article.},

abstract = {A hierarchical model of computer organizations is developed, based on a tree model using request/service type resources as nodes. Two aspects of the model are distinguished: logical and physical. General parallel- or multiple-stream organizations are examined as to type and effectiveness¿especially regarding intrinsic logical difficulties. The overlapped simplex processor (SISD) is limited by data dependencies. Branching has a particularly degenerative effect. The parallel processors [single-instruction stream-multiple-data stream (SIMD)] are analyzed. In particular, a nesting type explanation is offered for Minsky's conjecture¿the performance of a parallel processor increases as log M instead of M (the number of data stream processors). Multiprocessors (MIMD) are subjected to a saturation syndrome based on general communications lockout. Simplified queuing models indicate that saturation develops when the fraction of task time spent locked out (L/E) approaches 1/n, where n is the number of processors. Resources sharing in multiprocessors can be used to avoid several other classic organizational problems.},

@article{Cantwell2015,
abstract = {Nektar++ is an open-source software framework designed to support the development of high-performance scalable solvers for partial differential equations using the spectral/hp element method. High-order methods are gaining prominence in several engineering and biomedical applications due to their improved accuracy over low-order techniques at reduced computational cost for a given number of degrees of freedom. However, their proliferation is often limited by their complexity, which makes these methods challenging to implement and use. Nektar++ is an initiative to overcome this limitation by encapsulating the mathematical complexities of the underlying method within an efficient C++ framework, making the techniques more accessible to the broader scientific and industrial communities. The software supports a variety of discretisation techniques and implementation strategies, supporting methods research as well as application-focused computation, and the multi-layered structure of the framework allows the user to embrace as much or as little of the complexity as they need. The libraries capture the mathematical constructs of spectral/hp element methods, while the associated collection of pre-written PDE solvers provides out-of-the-box application-level functionality and a template for users who wish to develop solutions for addressing questions in their own scientific domains.

We demonstrate that our parallel SpGEMM methods, which use two-dimensional block data distributions with serial hypersparse kernels, are indeed highly flexible, scalable, and memory-efficient in the general case. This algorithm is the first to yield increasing speedup to an unbounded number of processors; our experiments show scaling up to thousands of processors in a variety of test scenarios.},

abstract = {A survey is given on fluid-dynamic effects caused by the structure and properties of biological surfaces. It is demonstrated that the results of investigations aiming at technological applications can also provide insights into biophysical phenomena. Techniques are described both for reducing wall shear stresses and for controlling boundary-layer separation. (a) Wall shear stress reduction was investigated experimentally for various riblet surfaces including a shark skin replica. The latter consists of 800 plastic model scales with compliant anchoring. Hairy surfaces are also considered, and surfaces in which the no-slip condition is modified. Self-cleaning surfaces such as that of lotus leaves represent an interesting option to avoid fluid-dynamic deterioration by the agglomeration of dirt. An example of technological implementation is discussed for riblets in long-range commercial aircraft. (b) Separation control is also an important issue in biology. After a few brief comments on vortex generators, the mechanism of separation control by bird feathers is described in detail. Self-activated movable flaps (= artificial bird feathers) represent a high-lift system enhancing the maximum lift of airfoils by about 20{\%}. This is achieved without perceivable deleterious effects under cruise conditions. Finally, flight experiments on an aircraft with laminar wing and movable flaps are presented.},

Here, we also report the self-assembly of the noncubic hexagonal phase and two lamellar phases, one with periodic convolutions. The periodic mesophase structures are emergent from the underlying conservation laws and quasi-molecular interactions of the lattice-Boltzmann model. We locate regions of the model's parameter space where the sequence of appearance of mesophases lamellar --{\textgreater} primitive --{\textgreater} hexagonal is in agreement with pressure jump experiments and the sequence cubic --{\textgreater} lamellar is in agreement with compositional variations reported in the literature. The ability of our lattice-Boltzmann model to simulate self-assembly of cubic and noncubic phases in a unified and consistent manner opens the way for further investigations into the transition pathways and kinetics of the phase transitions between these states as well as of the rheology of these phases.},

abstract = {THE CONTEXT OF PARALLEL PROCESSING The field of digital computer architecture has grown explosively in the past two decades. Through a steady stream of experimental research, tool-building efforts, and theoretical studies, the design of an instruction-set architecture, once considered an art, has been transformed into one of the most quantitative branches of computer technology. At the same time, better understanding of various forms of concurrency, from standard pipelining to massive parallelism, and invention of architectural structures to support a reasonably efficient and user-friendly programming model for such systems, has allowed hardware performance to continue its exponential growth. This trend is expected to continue in the near future. This explosive growth, linked with the expectation that performance will continue its exponential rise with each new generation of hardware and that (in stark contrast to software) computer hardware will function correctly as soon as it comes off the assembly line, has its down side. It has led to unprecedented hardware complexity and almost intolerable dev- opment costs. The challenge facing current and future computer designers is to institute simplicity where we now have complexity; to use fundamental theories being developed in this area to gain performance and ease-of-use benefits from simpler circuits; to understand the interplay between technological capabilities and limitations, on the one hand, and design decisions based on user and application requirements on the other.},

abstract = {Computational aeroacoustic (CAA) simulation requires accurate schemes to capture the dynamics of acoustic fluctuations, which are weak compared with aerodynamic ones. In this paper, two kinds of schemes are studied and compared: the classical approach based on high order schemes for Navier-Stokes-like equations and the lattice Boltzmann method. The reference macroscopic equations are the 3D isothermal and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. A Von Neumann analysis of these linearized equations is carried out to obtain exact plane wave solutions. Three physical modes are recovered and the corresponding theoretical dispersion relations are obtained. Then the same analysis is made on the space and time discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations with the classical high order schemes to quantify the influence of both space and time discretization on the exact solutions. Different orders of discretization are considered, with and without a uniform mean flow. Three different lattice Boltzmann models are then presented and studied with the Von Neumann analysis. The theoretical dispersion relations of these models are obtained and the error terms of the model are identified and studied. It is shown that the dispersion error in the lattice Boltzmann models is only due to the space and time discretization and that the continuous discrete velocity Boltzmann equation yield the same exact dispersion as the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, dispersion and dissipation errors of the different kind of schemes are quantitatively compared. It is found that the lattice Boltzmann method is less dissipative than high order schemes and less dispersive than a second order scheme in space with a 3-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time. The number of floating point operations at a given error level associated with these two kinds of schemes are then compared. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We outline a new class of robust and efficient methods for solving subproblems that arise in the linearization and operator splitting of Navier–Stokes equations. We describe a very general strategy for preconditioning that has two basic building blocks; a multigrid V-cycle for the scalar convection–diffusion operator, and a multigrid V-cycle for a pressure Poisson operator. We present numerical experiments illustrating that a simple implementation of our approach leads to an effective and robust solver strategy in that the convergence rate is independent of the grid, robust with respect to the time-step, and only deteriorates very slowly as the Reynolds number is increased.},

Recently, they have focused their attention on the design of a 64-processor prototype that tests most of their ideas about scalability. In this paper, they describe the factors that traditionally limited the scalability of shared memory systems. These include enforcing sequential consistency, inefficient synchronization, memory latency and bandwidth limitations, bus and memory contention, the necessity to enforce inclusion on lower-level caches, and limited I/O (input/output) bandwidth. They then describe how the Willow architecture addresses each of these issues. Finally, they present data in order to evaluate the effect of the major architectural innovations in Willow on the performance of several parallel applications},

@article{Barber2006,
abstract = {It has long been recognized that the fluid mechanics of gas-phase microflows can differ significantly from the macroscopic world. Non-equilibrium effects such as rarefaction and gas-surface interactions need to be taken into account, and it is well known that the no-slip boundary condition of the Navier-Stokes equations is no longer valid. Following ideas proposed by Maxwell, it is generally accepted that the Navier-Stokes equations can be extended into the slip-flow regime, provided the Knudsen number is less than 10−1. Improvements in micro-fabrication techniques, however, are now enabling devices to be constructed with sub-micron feature sizes. At this scale, the flow will depart even further from equilibrium and will enter the transition regime. In recent years, there has been considerable success in the implementation of second-order slip-boundary conditions to extend the Navier-Stokes equations into the transition regime. Unfortunately, as yet, no consensus has been reached on the correct form of higher-order approach, with theoretical and experimental studies revealing large discrepancies in the magnitude of the second-order slip coefficient. It is believed that these discrepancies can be explained by the fact that continuum flow analyses neglect the Knudsen layer, which extends approximately one mean-free path from the channel wall. In addition, comparisons between kinetic and continuum slip-boundary formulations reveal another important source of error due to different definitions in the first-order slip coefficient. The paper explains how these discrepancies have arisen and describes future research directions that may help reconcile the different forms of higher-order approach.},

abstract = {This paper offers a simple macroscopic approach to the question of the slip boundary condition to be imposed upon the tangential component of the fluid velocity at a solid boundary. Plausible reasons are advanced for believing that it is the energy equation rather than the momentum equation that determines the correct fluid- mechanical boundary condition.Theschemeresulting therefrom furnishes the following general, near-equilibrium linear constitutive relation for the slip velocity of mass along a relatively flat wall bounding a single-component gas or liquid: (vm)slip =−$\alpha$∂ ln $\rho$/∂s|wall,where $\alpha$ and $\rho$ are, respectively, the fluid's thermometric diffusivity and mass density, while the length $\delta$s refers to distance measured along the wall in the direction in which the slip or creep occurs. This constitutive relation is shown to agree with experimental data for gases and liquids undergoing thermal creep or pressure-driven viscous creep at solid surfaces.},
