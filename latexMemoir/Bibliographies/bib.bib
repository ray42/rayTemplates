abstract = {A new technique is described for the numerical investigation of the timedependent flow of an incompressible fluid, the boundary of which is partially confined and partially free. The full NavierStokes equations are written in finitedifference form, and the solution is accomplished by finitetimestep advancement. The primary dependent variables are the pressure and the velocity components. Also used is a set of marker particles which move with the fluid. The technique is called the marker and cell method. Some examples of the application of this method are presented. All nonlinear effects are completely included, and the transient aspects can be computed for as much elapsed time as desired.},

The key feature of our approach is that the preconditioning can be realized using any black-box multigrid solver designed for the discrete Dirichlet Laplacian operator. This leads to preconditioned systems having an eigenvalue distribution consisting of a tightly clustered set together with a small number of outliers. Numerical results show that the performance of the methodology is competitive with that of specialized fast iteration methods that have been developed in the context of biharmonic problems.},

We describe a very general strategy for preconditioning that has two basic building blocks; a multigrid V-cycle for the scalar convectiondiffusion operator, and a multigrid V-cycle for a pressure Poisson operator. We present numerical experiments illustrating that a simple implementation of our approach leads to an effective and robust solver strategy in that the convergence rate is independent of the grid, robust with respect to the time-step, and only deteriorates very slowly as the Reynolds number is increased.},

abstract = {We use a fully coupled, three-dimensional, finite-element method to study the evolution of the surface-tension-driven instabilities of a liquid layer that lines an elastic tube, a simple model for pulmonary airway closure. The equations of large-displacement shell theory are used to describe the deformations of the tube and are coupled to the NavierStokes equations, describing the motion of the liquid. The liquid layer is susceptible to a capillary instability, whereby an initially uniform layer can develop a series of axisymmetric peaks and troughs, analogous to the classical instability that causes liquid jets to break up into droplets. For sufficiently high values of the liquid's surface tension, relative to the bending stiffness of the tube, the additional compressive load induced by the development of the axisymmetric instability can induce non-axisymmetric buckling of the tube wall. Once the tube has buckled, a strong destabilizing feedback between the fluid and solid mechanics leads to an extremely rapid further collapse and occlusion of the gas-conveying core of the tube by the liquid. We find that such occlusion is possible even when the volume of the liquid is too small to form an occluding liquid bridge in the axisymmetric tube.},

An improved understanding of cardiac mechanics is necessary to advance the diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases. This article explains techniques for visualizing and evaluating biomedical finite element models and demonstrates their application to biomedical data sets by using, as an example, two models of a healthy and a diseased human left ventricle. The following contributions are made: we apply techniques traditionally used in solid mechanics and computational fluid dynamics to biomedical data and suggest some improvements and modifications. We obtain new insight into the mechanics of the healthy and diseased left ventricle and we facilitate, the understanding of the complex deformation of the heart muscle by novel visualizations. Finally, we also introduce in this process a toolkit designed for visualizing biomedical data sets."

abstract = {A novel proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model has been developed for use with an advanced unstructured mesh finite-element ocean model, the Imperial College Ocean Model (ICOM, described in detail below), which includes many recent developments in ocean modelling and numerical analysis. The advantages of the POD model developed here over existing POD approaches are the ability: 1. To increase accuracy when representing geostrophic balance (the balance between the Coriolis terms and the pressure gradient). This is achieved through the use of two sets of geostrophic basis functions where each one is calculated by basis functions for velocities u and v. 2. To speed up the POD simulation. To achieve this a new numerical technique is introduced, whereby a time-dependent matrix in the discretized equation is rapidly constructed from a series of time- independent matrices. This development imparts considerable efficiency gains over the often-used alternative of calculating each finite element over the computational domain at each time level. 3. To use dynamically adaptive meshes in the above POD model.},

abstract = {The ability to extend the valid frequency range for finite element based structural dynamic predictions using detailed models of the structural components and attachment interfaces is examined for several stiffened aircraft fuselage structures. This extended dynamic prediction capability is needed for the integration of mid-frequency noise control technology. Beam, plate and solid element models of the stiffener components are evaluated. Attachment models between the stiffener and panel skin range from a line along the rivets of the physical structure to a constraint over the entire contact surface. The finite element models are validated using experimental modal analysis results. The increased frequency range results in a corresponding increase in the number of modes, modal density and spatial resolution requirements. In this study, conventional modal tests using accelerometers are complemented with Scanning Laser Doppler Velocimetry and Electro-Optic Holography measurements to further resolve the spatial response characteristics. Whenever possible, component and subassembly modal tests are used to validate the finite element models at lower levels of assembly. Normal mode predictions for different finite element representations of components and assemblies are compared with experimental results to assess the most accurate techniques for modeling aircraft fuselage type structures.},
