Removing control symbols only:

:%s/[[:cntrl:]]//g
Removing non-printable characters (removes non-ASCII characters also):

:%s/[^[:print:]]//g

do stuff in all tabs:
use tabdo instead of bufdo
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace_in_multiple_buffers
:bufdo %s/pattern/replace/ge | update

bufdo     Apply the following commands to all buffers.
%s        Search and replace all lines in the buffer.
pattern   Search pattern.
replace   Replacement text.
g         Change all occurrences in each line (global).
e         No error if the pattern is not found.
|         Separator between commands.
update    Save (write file only if changes were made).

The command above uses :update to save each buffer, if it was changed. That is
necessary because, by default, Vim will not switch away from a buffer if it has
been changed.
